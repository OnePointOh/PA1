        <h1> Bio </h1>
        My name is Trevor Hatch. I am a Computer Science Major at Texas A&M University, class of 2023. I graduated from
        BASIS San Antonio Shavano Campus in 2019. Since high school I have been passionate about the field of AI and machine
        learning. Through online articles, videos, and my own personal projects I have expanded my knowledge of AI and machine
        learning. I am currently looking for an internship for the Summer of 2022. I am expierenced in both Python and C++, and
        I am confident in my ability to learn any new skills necessary for any new challenges.
        <h1> Projects </h1>
        <div>
            <strong> Neural Network Pathfinding </strong> 2018
            <div>
                The goal of this project was to experiment with the concepts of <strong> genetic algorithms </strong> and
                <strong> neural networks </strong>. In this project I programmed an algorithm which saught to find
                the quickest path to a goal, while avoiding user-drwan obsticals. This program would iteratively create populations
                of neural networks, test their ability, then rank them and create a new population weighted towards the more sucessful
                individuals. Each individual is fed information about how far it can travel in a cardinal direction before hitting
                a boundary. Then, this information is processed through its' neural network and the individual chooses a direction to
                travel in. I experimented with different modes of movement, from traveling in a locked cardinal direction, traveling
                in any 2d euclidian direction at a fixed rate, traveling with speed depending on output, and finally giving each individual
                momentum and taking the output as a force instead of the exact direction of travel. Each of these iterations of travel
                provided interesting results.

            <strong> MNIST Handwriting </strong> 2019
            <div>
                The goal of this project was to experiment with the concepts of <strong> supervised learning </strong> and <strong> backpropagation </strong>.
                In this project I used Python without any machine learning libraries. From scratch, I programmed a neural network
                that learned to interpret human handwriting. The MNIST dataset was used to train the neural network. In this
                project I also expierimented with different shapes of neural networks and analaysed how those shapes affected
                training time and accuracy.
