        <h1> Community Service</h1>
        I am an active member of my community. Growing up, community service was an important aspect of my life. As a Boy Scout,
        I participated in many community service projects. For my own Eagle Scout project I worked with the San Antonio Food Bank,
        by installing signs for their volunteer farms and landscaping those signs.
